# Field-aware-Factorization-Machines
Field-aware Factorization Machines model implemented in spark, Stochastic gradient descent was applied in this first version. Following features are planed, including early stopping for over-fitting, momentum and self-adaption learning rate type gradient methods for speeding up train procedure, etc...

* See test.scala for reference.
* See \<\<Field-aware Factorization Machines for CTR prediction, Y Juan, Y Zhuang, WS Chin, CJ Lin\>\> for mathematical derivation. http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/ffm.pdf
* If you are unsatisfy about the learning speed, please enlarge initialization value of weights.
* Please feel free to contact me if you have any question about the source code.
